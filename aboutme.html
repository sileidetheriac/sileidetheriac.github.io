 			<p>Thank you for checking out my school project website!!<br>
 			My name is Sileide Theriac. I was born in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia. My family moved to the East coast when I was 7 years old just so we could live by the beach. It was such a wonderful experience growing up so close to the ocean. Listening to the sound of waves and walking in the sand was a common part of my daily routine.<br>
 			In 2007, I got my first Bachelors Degree in International Relations and in 2010, I moved to Tampa, Florida, where I ended up meeting my husband. We have been together since then and we have two wonderful little boys, Tristan and Jack.<br>
 			Today we live in Houston, Texas. It is such a joy to be going back to school for a second degree in Computer Science while being a full-time mom. Wonderful, yes, but not easy. My boys are a handful, but they are the joy of my life!<br>
 			I plan on exploring my technical capabilities and learning more programming languages. I am hoping to get an internship in either software development, web development or in cyber security sometime soon. I just love learning!</p>
